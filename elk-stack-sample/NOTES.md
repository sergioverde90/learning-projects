# UP & RUNNING BUT...

* First time you run elastic there will be no index created. If you use the filebeat-interactive tool, an index will be created automatically, but still you have to create a dataview in the 'Discovery' section to visualize the streaming data from filebeat.

* Elastichsearch is configured to be running with security enabled (see the environment configuration in the docker-compose.yml file regarding the xpack.security properties). If you try to cURL elastic directly you will recive an empty server response. If you disable security the cURL will start working BUT DO NOT DO THIS. Instead, use https://localhost:9200 with the -k (or --insecure) option, and use the -u user:password flag to use basic authentication in the request. That should allow the cURL to reach elastic and return a response.
