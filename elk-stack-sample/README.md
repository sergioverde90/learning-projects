# ABOUT THIS LEARNING PROJECT

This project is intended to be used as a "from zero to hero" approach for the ELK stack.

The main idea is to configure Elasticsearch, Logstash with Filebeat and Kibana to show log data published by a running service.

## TASKS

* Filebeat up & running :white_check_mark:
* Pusblish some logs directly from Filebeat to ElasticSearch :x:
* Add Logstash in the middle for log processing :x:
* Use Kibana to see the generated logs :x:
* Put a real application publishing logs and see the e2e process :x:
