# Elasticsearch Study Plan

This plan is divided into modules. Try to complete them sequentially, ensuring you understand each concept before moving to the next. Hands-on practice is crucial, so set up an Elasticsearch instance early on.

**Goal:** Understand what Elasticsearch is, its core concepts, and common use cases.

**Topics:**

1.  **What is Elasticsearch?**
    * Search engine, NoSQL database, analytics platform.
    * Use cases: Log analytics, full-text search, real-time application monitoring, business analytics, etc.
2.  **Core Concepts:**
    * **Document:** Basic unit of information (JSON).
    * **Index:** A collection of documents with similar characteristics (like a database table).
    * **Node:** A single server that is part of a cluster.
    * **Cluster:** A collection of one or more nodes.
    * **Shard:** Indices are horizontally divided into shards for distribution and scalability.
        * Primary Shard
        * Replica Shard
    * **Mapping:** Schema definition for an index (data types, how fields are indexed).
    * **REST APIs:** Interacting with Elasticsearch.
3.  **Elastic Stack (ELK/Elastic Stack):**
    * Kibana: Visualization and management UI.
    * Logstash: Data ingestion and processing pipeline.
    * Beats: Lightweight data shippers.

**Learning Activities:**

* Read the "What is Elasticsearch?" and "Basic Concepts" sections of the official Elasticsearch documentation.

### Module 3: Search & Aggregations üîçüìä

**Goal:** Master Elasticsearch's powerful search and aggregation capabilities.

**Topics:**

1.  **Query DSL Deep Dive:**
    * **Queries vs. Filters:** Understanding the difference and when to use each.
    * **Term-level queries:** `term`, `terms`, `range`, `exists`, `prefix`.
    * **Full-text queries:** `match`, `match_phrase`, `multi_match`, `query_string`.
    * **Compound queries:** `bool` (must, should, must_not, filter), `constant_score`.
    * **Joining queries** (nested, has_child, has_parent - if applicable to your use cases).
2.  **Analyzers and Mappings:**
    * How text is analyzed (tokenizers, token filters, character filters).
    * Standard analyzer vs. other built-in analyzers.
    * Defining custom analyzers.
    * Explicit mapping: Defining data types, indexing options (`analyzed`, `not_analyzed` - now `text` and `keyword`).
3.  **Sorting and Pagination.**
4.  **Aggregations:**
    * **Bucket Aggregations:** `terms`, `range`, `date_histogram`, `nested`.
    * **Metric Aggregations:** `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `cardinality`, `stats`.
    * Combining aggregations.

**Learning Activities:**

* Work through Query DSL examples in the documentation.
* Define custom mappings for your indices.
* Experiment with different analyzers to see how text is tokenized.
* Create complex queries combining multiple clauses.
* Build various aggregations on your sample data.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks

### Module 4: Elasticsearch Internals - Architecture & Data Handling ‚öôÔ∏è

**Goal:** Understand how Elasticsearch works under the hood.

**Topics:**

1.  **Distributed Architecture:**
    * **Cluster Discovery & Master Election:** How nodes find each other and elect a master.
    * **Shard Allocation & Routing:** How Elasticsearch distributes shards and routes requests.
    * **Replication Process:** How data is kept consistent across primary and replica shards.
    * **Fault Tolerance & High Availability.**
2.  **Indexing Internals (Lucene Basics):** (Elasticsearch Definitive Guide - Chapter 11 Inside a shard)
    * **Inverted Index:** The core data structure.
    * **Segments:** How data is stored and managed in Lucene.
    * **Commits & Translog:** Durability and data recovery.
    * **Refresh, Flush, Merge:** Operations affecting data visibility and segment management.
3.  **Search Internals:**
    * **Query Execution Flow:** How a search request is processed across the cluster (scatter-gather).
    * **Relevance & Scoring:**
        * TF-IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency) - conceptual understanding.
        * BM25 (Okapi BM25) - the default similarity algorithm.
        * How scores are calculated.
    * **Fielddata and Doc Values:** Understanding their purpose and impact on memory.

**Learning Activities:**

* Read blogs and articles about Elasticsearch/Lucene internals.
* Use monitoring APIs (`_cat` APIs, `_cluster/stats`, `_nodes/stats`) to observe cluster behavior.
* Simulate node failures (if you have a multi-node setup) to see how the cluster reacts.
* Analyze query explanations (`explain=true`) to understand scoring.
